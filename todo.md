# To-Do List: Building YouTube Downloader SaaS

## Phase 1: MVP (4–6 Weeks)
**Goal:** Build a basic version with single video downloads in limited formats.

### Week 1: Setup & Research
#### Choose Tech Stack
- [ ] Decide on Node.js/Express or Python/Flask for backend.
- [ ] Select React.js or Vue.js for frontend.

#### Set Up Project
- [ ] Initialize Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
- [ ] Set up project folders: `/frontend`, `/backend`.
- [ ] Install dependencies (e.g., `npm init` or `pip install`).

#### Research YouTube Downloading
- [ ] Install and test yt-dlp locally (`pip install yt-dlp` or equivalent).
- [ ] Run a sample command: `yt-dlp <youtube-url>` to confirm it works.

#### Legal Check
- [ ] Draft a basic disclaimer for personal use to include in the app.

### Week 2: Backend Basics
#### Set Up Server
- [ ] Create a basic Express/Flask server.
- [ ] Test with a simple endpoint (e.g., GET `/health` returns "OK").

#### Integrate yt-dlp
- [ ] Write a function to download a YouTube video using yt-dlp.
- [ ] Test with MP4 720p output.

#### Add Audio Conversion
- [ ] Install ffmpeg (`brew install ffmpeg` or equivalent).
- [ ] Add a function to convert video to MP3 128kbps using ffmpeg.

#### API Endpoint
- [ ] Create POST `/process` to accept a URL and return a file path.

### Week 3: Frontend Basics
#### Set Up Frontend
- [ ] Initialize React/Vue project (`npx create-react-app` or `vue create`).
- [ ] Add a simple UI with an input field and "Download" button.

#### Connect to Backend
- [ ] Use Axios to call `/process` with the URL.
- [ ] Display a "Processing" message on submit.

#### Handle Download
- [ ] Serve the file from the backend (e.g., GET `/download/:id`).
- [ ] Add a download link to the frontend after processing.

### Week 4: Testing & Deployment
#### Test MVP
- [ ] Test with 5 different YouTube URLs.
- [ ] Verify MP4 720p and MP3 128kbps downloads work.

#### Fix Bugs
- [ ] Handle errors (e.g., invalid URLs, unavailable videos).

#### Deploy
- [ ] Set up a basic server (e.g., DigitalOcean Droplet or Heroku).
- [ ] Deploy backend and frontend.
- [ ] Test live URL input and download.

## Phase 2: Core Features (6–8 Weeks)
**Goal:** Add time range selection, more formats, and playlist support.

### Week 5: Time Range Feature
#### Backend: Trimming
- [ ] Update ffmpeg function to accept start/end times (e.g., `-ss 00:01:00 -to 00:04:00`).
- [ ] Test trimming a video and audio file.

#### Frontend: UI
- [ ] Add two input fields for start/end times (HH:MM:SS format).
- [ ] Add input validation (e.g., ensure times are valid and within duration).

#### API Update
- [ ] Modify `/process` to accept `startTime` and `endTime` parameters.

### Week 6: Format & Quality Options
#### Backend: Formats
- [ ] Extend yt-dlp to support MP4 (144p–1080p) and WEBM.
- [ ] Add MP3 (64–320kbps), M4A, and WAV using ffmpeg.

#### Frontend: UI
- [ ] Add dropdowns for "Video/Audio," format, and quality.
- [ ] Fetch available formats from `/fetch-metadata` endpoint.

#### API Update
- [ ] Create POST `/fetch-metadata` to return video details (duration, formats).

### Week 7: Playlist Support
#### Backend: Playlist Parsing
- [ ] Use yt-dlp to fetch playlist metadata (`--get-id`, `--get-title`).
- [ ] Return a list of video IDs and titles.

#### Frontend: UI
- [ ] Display playlist videos with checkboxes after URL input.
- [ ] Allow "Select All" or individual selection.

#### API Update
- [ ] Extend `/process` to handle multiple video IDs.

### Week 8: Testing & Refinement
#### Test Core Features
- [ ] Test trimming with 3 videos.
- [ ] Test all formats and qualities.
- [ ] Test a playlist with 5+ videos.

#### UI Polish
- [ ] Add a progress bar for processing.
- [ ] Improve error messages (e.g., "Video unavailable").

#### Redeploy
- [ ] Update live server with new features.

## Phase 3: Polish & Scale (4–6 Weeks)
**Goal:** Enhance UX and prepare for scale.

### Week 9: UX Improvements
#### Responsive Design
- [ ] Use CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind or Bootstrap) for mobile support.
- [ ] Test on desktop, tablet, and phone.

#### Progress Feedback
- [ ] Add real-time status (e.g., "Fetching," "Converting").

#### Error Handling
- [ ] Gracefully handle edge cases (e.g., private videos).

### Week 10: Scaling
#### Queue System
- [ ] Integrate Bull.js (Node) or Celery (Python) for task queuing.
- [ ] Test with 5 simultaneous requests.

#### Storage
- [ ] Set up AWS S3 or local filesystem for temporary storage.
- [ ] Add 24-hour expiration for files.

#### Redeploy
- [ ] Update server with queue and storage.

### Week 11: Final Testing
#### Load Test
- [ ] Simulate 10 concurrent users.

#### Bug Fixes
- [ ] Address any issues from testing.

#### Documentation
- [ ] Write a basic README for setup and usage.

## Phase 4: Premium Features (6–8 Weeks)
**Goal:** Add premium features and monetization.

### Week 12: Batch Processing
#### Backend
- [ ] Optimize queue for batch playlist downloads.

#### Frontend
- [ ] Add a "Batch Download" button for selected playlist videos.

### Week 13: Cloud Integration
#### Backend
- [ ] Integrate Google Drive/Dropbox APIs for file export.

#### Frontend
- [ ] Add a "Save to Cloud" option post-processing.

### Week 14: User Accounts & Payments
#### Backend
- [ ] Set up user authentication (e.g., Firebase or JWT).
- [ ] Integrate Stripe for subscriptions.

#### Frontend
- [ ] Add login/signup pages.
- [ ] Create a pricing page ($5–10/month).

### Week 15: Final Features
#### Priority Processing
- [ ] Add a fast queue for premium users.

#### Analytics
- [ ] Track user downloads (optional dashboard).

## General Notes
- **Tools:** Use VS Code, Git, Postman (for API testing), and a cloud provider (e.g., DigitalOcean).
- **Time Estimates:** Adjust based on your pace; assumes 20–30 hours/week.
- **Checkpoints:** Test after each week to catch issues early.
